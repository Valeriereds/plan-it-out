# plan-it-out

## Description

I've created this weekday planner to showcase all the skills I have learned so far using JQuery and Bootstrap. I started this project with only a basic understanding of these elements, but through this endeavor I was able to research, understand, and implement different variables, functions and elements within the script and HTML. The biggest problem I had to overcome was creating a conditional statement to change the color of the hour block according to the current hour vs the past/present. Diving more into day.js really helped me understand which formatting I needed for the time blocks. !t took a lot of trial and error to get that conditional to work. This project also introduced me to the easier method of writing javascript by using jquery. I'm still learning, though, and with time, google and expertise, I hope to come back to this project with the answers to its problems. I hope this webpage can help any users with their daily planning needs!
